# Desktop Quick Chat (Khoj Mini)

Once you have the Khoj [desktop application](https://khoj.dev/downloads) installed, you can use the desktop shortcut to quickly pull up a mini chat module for quicker answers. See the desktop setup instructions [in the docs](/clients/desktop.md) for more information.

To use it, you just have to copy the text you want to inject into your query, and then run `Ctrl + Shift + K` (or `Cmd + Shift + K` on Mac) to open the mini chat module. The text you copied will be automatically pasted into the chat module, and you can then hit enter to get the answer. You can edit the text before hitting enter if you want to refine your query.

The desktop shortcut is a great way to quickly get answers to your questions without having to switch between windows or tabs. It's especially useful when you're working on a project and need to quickly look up something without losing your focus.
