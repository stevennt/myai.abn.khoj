# File Summarization

You can use the `/summarize` command to get Khoj to generate context driven summaries of your documents.
Simply select a single file filter on the left panel menu and then use `/summarize [any context]` and Khoj
will produce a tailored summary of the text.

You can also try a natural language query which include the intent for summary without explicitly using the `/summarize` command.

## Example Usage

* `/summarize in a way that can be used as practice questions for a test`
* `/summarize in a way a toddler can understand`
* `/summarize in one paragraph`

Without using the `/summarize` command:
* `create a summary of the document in a way that can be used as practice questions for a test`
* `summarize the document in a way a toddler can understand`
* `generate a one paragraph summary of the document`
