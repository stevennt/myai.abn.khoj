# Automations

[Automations](https://app.khoj.dev/automations) are a powerful feature within Khoj to schedule repeated tasks for information retrieval directly from your account. You can run them at a specific time and interval. This is still an experimental feature, so please report any issues you encounter.

Khoj will use your local time zone to determine the scheduling localization. You can go back and configure the prompt any time you want from the automations page. You can also delete the automation if you no longer need it.

:::danger[Note]
Automations will not deliver emails to self-hosted users out of the box. You'll have to have Resend and [Authentication](/advanced/authentication) setup to send emails.
