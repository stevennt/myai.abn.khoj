# Upload your data

There are several ways you can get started with sharing your data with the Khoj AI.

- Drag and drop your documents via [the web UI](/clients/web/#upload-documents). This is best if you have a one-off document you need to interact with.
- Use the desktop app to [upload and sync your documents](/clients/desktop). This is best if you have a lot of documents on your computer or you need the docs to stay in sync.
- Setup the sync options for either [Obsidian](/clients/obsidian) or [Emacs](/clients/emacs) to automatically sync your documents with Khoj. This is best if you are already using these tools and want to leverage ABN's AI capabilities.
- Configure your [Notion](/data-sources/notion_integration) or [Github](/data-sources/github_integration) to sync with Khoj. By providing your credentials, you can keep the data synced in the background.
